# RuseCruise

Maven Dependencies
  Add necessary .jar files to run
  Results in a .jar file
  Run the resulting .jar file in command line (for now as of 3/6/18)
    Command:
      java -jar <jar_name>.jar
    Location of jar:
      eclipse-workspace/<project_name>/target/<jar_name>.jar
  Small possibilitly other .jar files will need to manually be downloaded (I think maven will do this automatically though)

Other Notes (03/06/2018):
  JSON info that is in the main now should become a class I think.
  The JSON code is very (very) rudientary and very much needs to be expanded.
